# 🚧 Road Accident Analysis

This project performs an in-depth analysis of road accident data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It explores accident trends, contributing factors, and visual insights to aid in understanding and potentially reducing road mishaps.

## 📊 Project Overview

The notebook contains:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of accident statistics
- Insights and potential risk factors
- Summary and suggestions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas**: Data processing
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive code and plots

## 📁 Files

- `Road_Accident_Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook with complete analysis
- `accident_data.csv`: (Assumed) Dataset file used in the analysis

> _Note: Please ensure the dataset file is placed in the same directory as the notebook, or update the path accordingly._

## 🚀 How to Run
